# READ!

Here is basicly everything you need, to make ur own working executor.
The files are intended for beginners at script/exploit-ing what means: Dont think that the files are very overpowered.
Its a simple "Starter Kit"

# _Be aware!_
The API will most likely be outdated, I will try to find a new "aka" working one asap.
And yes, it is using Xeno, but dont worry, if u dont like Xeno at all you either make ur own API or wait for sm1 to leak source.
I hope this helps you.
